# ServerFunctions
Simple Plugin, used as a reference guide for applications

This is just a simple plugin I created that implements a few viable server functions such as:
/totalexp
/exp
And a Join Message!

There are many more things I can do with this, I just wanted to upload this simple plugin to my Github Repository as a reference guide for applications!
